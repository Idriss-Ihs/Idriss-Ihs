# Idris Ihs — Data Scientist

Curious by nature and driven by the challenge of transforming ideas into measurable results.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, research, and applied innovation** — where theory meets implementation and problems are solved through experimentation.

My work spans the full data lifecycle: from **data engineering and modeling** to **analysis, visualization, and deployment**.  
I’m particularly interested in how data science can be **applied across domains** — discovering patterns, building predictive systems, and developing tools that bring insight and precision to complex questions.

Beyond the code, I value clarity, reproducibility, and well-structured thinking — principles that make collaboration and progress sustainable over time.
